gurux_dlms_ library is a high-performance Python component that helps you to read you DLMS/COSEM compatible electricity, gas or water meters. We have try to make component so easy to use that you do not need understand protocol at all.

For more info check out [Gurux.DLMS](https://www.gurux.fi/Gurux.DLMS "Gurux.DLMS").

We are updating documentation on Gurux web page. 

Read should read [DLMS/COSEM FAQ](https://www.gurux.fi/DLMSCOSEMFAQ) and [basics](https://www.gurux.fi/DLMSInNutshell) first to get started.

Reporting issues and feature requests
=========================== 

DLMS is a complex protocol, and an idea that seems good in theory may not work with all meters. Before reposting the issue it's good to talk from the problem in [Gurux forum](https://www.gurux.fi/forum).
Inability to read the meter is not an issue.
You can report the [issues](https://www.gurux.fi/project/issues/gurux.dlms.python). 

Dual license

Gurux products are [dual licensed](https://gurux.fi/OpenSource).

Development
=========================== 

You do not necessary need to use Gurux media component like gurux.net.python or gurux.serial.python 
You can use any connection library you want to.
Gurux.DLMS classes only generate and parse the DLMS data.
